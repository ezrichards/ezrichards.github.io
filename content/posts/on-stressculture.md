The most stressful time of my life was the Spring 2024 semester.
I was taking 6 classes (18 credits). I was a lead TA for a class and was managing 
the (now-defunct) OreCart project. I was the Mines ACM President and HSPC Chair. Additionally, 
for a little while during the start of spring, I was preparing to present my research at SIGCSE. 
I also played intramural soccer a little later in the spring.

It sucked. I stopped eating a lot, and what I did eat was crap. I 
stopped exercising, because there was seemingly no time to. I stopped meditating. I slept less, because
I needed to get up and get to the library to get work done. There was no time for family or friends whatsoever. 
I made two new friends that I enjoyed that semester, and made an effort to see them amongst everything else, 
which was incredibly stressful too, as I knew I was hurting every other aspect of my life.

**Something has to give**. I was quite simply doing too much for
things not to give; giving my attention to one thing meant seriously downgrading how
effective I was at another thing. **When your health is what begins to give**,
that's the sign that you need to rethink your priorities.

Unfortunately, this is the saddening reality for a lot of people. I'm in a privileged
position where I'm economically stable, but I know people in these positions who aren't
quite the same and need to work on top of school to survive. This culture also encourages 
coping in the wrong ways, with alcohol or drugs, which I can proudly say I never did, but I
again know people who cope that way.

## The New Culture

_**Stressculture**_: A culture where performance outweighs the good of
your own health and emphasizes greatness at the cost of immense stress.

I always thought I needed to prove myself to everybody. Part of
it was personal, but part of it was because I felt threatened or afraid
that I wasn't smart enough to succeed. I never thought I would succeed 
unless I worked harder than absolutely everybody all of the time.

Unfortunately, these sentiments seem pretty common in today's age, and 
almost exemplify the American dream of becoming rich and wealthy if you
just work harder than everybody always. We're taught as kids to follow
our dreams and that anything is possible if you put your mind to it (which is good)
but we're not told how to do that in a healthy way.

## The Science

Running from thing to thing like I did is a bad idea. Somewhat new cognitive
science tells us about [context switching](https://asana.com/resources/context-switching) and [attention residue](https://www.uwb.edu/business/faculty/sophie-leroy/attention-residue#:~:text=â€œAttention%20residue%20easily%20occurs%20when,rush%20to%20get%20it%20done.);
both of which suggest that switching between lots of things can be mentally taxing.

Especially if you're doing creative or novel work, this can drag you down.
**Creativity comes when you let go**. If you never let go, it's not to say
you can't be creative, but it's going to be much harder to get those ideas.
Think about it: when do you get creative ideas? In the shower? On the toilet?
On a walk? Before sleeping? It's almost always when we least expect it, but definitely
when we're not fully attentive to a different task.

When was the last time you sat down and did nothing? Your brain needs time to recuperate
between so much work and so many switched tasks. When was the last time you *stopped*,
and simply listened to your breath?

Mindfulness meditation is a growing "treatment" in this area, if you want to call it that.
But beyond that, it can help you understand yourself and the world better. If nothing else,
it will give you a healthy break from doing things. A free app called the [Healthy Minds Program](https://www.portal.hminnovations.org/launch) (which is tied with a lab in [UW Madison](https://centerhealthyminds.org)) is a great place to start that I would personally recommend.

## Creating boundaries

The best advice I ever got from my research advisor (or honestly anyone)
was to **say no** to things. His analogy goes as follows: work is like a gas. 
If you just try to run around waving it toward some direction, or trying
to contain it from spreading, it's going to do nothing. More of
it is going to keep finding you, too, if you don't set boundaries.
You have to **build walls** in your life to stop it from spreading.

It's hard to do less, especially in the middle of a school term, but there is really
always a safe way out: whether it's resigning from a project, withdrawing from a class,
or simply taking a break.

## Solutions

I remember the point at which I wanted it to all stop was when I was speaking to my roommate;
he would ask about things like ACM and OreCart, and I would try to explain, only to have
long, awkward, 15-second pauses where I would look around and try to find my words because
my head was so jam-packed with (literally) 10 things at the same time. My memory got much
worse, and I developed a stutter because there was so much going on in my head and it was
moving quicker than my mouth could.

It wasn't worth it. I finished out the semester, but to many people's surprise, I
immediately resigned as Mines ACM President + HSPC Chair (despite what I think was
a community that I built that enjoyed my leadership) because I just *couldn't* cope.
OreCart would unfortunately fall through over the summer, which was incredibly sad,
but not bad for my health. I tried to promise myself I would never do 18 credits again,
but I did again in the fall; however, I coped much better having much less on my plate.

I'll talk about each of these in more detail, but here's an outline of things 
that may help you avoid making the mistakes I did:
- Set boundaries
- Wait to say yes (and say no!)
- Think about the small things

..and some things that don't help:
- Just sticking it out
- Drugs/alcohol/other harmful things
- Saying yes to more things

<!-- set boundaries -->
Set boundaries (or with our analogy, build walls).
As an adult (barely), I've noticed that older people and adults are great at this, and this
goes unspoken for quite some time. Whenever you're staring down your next semester or work
project or new big idea, ask yourself what you're willing to sacrifice, what things you could
leave behind, and how you're going to change from doing everything all of the time.

<!-- wait to say yes -->
I recommend everyone I know to do less, probably to an annoying extent. People come to me
in similar situations and I tell them to say no to things - we often say yes to everything
because 1) we're nice people, but 2) we see opportunity in things. If you want to say
yes to something, sleep on it. Ideally give it a week to decide. See how willing you are
to say yes after waiting awhile.

<!-- the small things -->
..maybe equally if not more importantly, **think about the small things** too. It astounds me how many 
people ignore, for instance, time to eat or sleep in their schedule. They just don't care or pretend 
it doesn't matter. IT DOES! These are the foundations that will allow you to do things to begin with.
You don't have to schedule friend-time, but think about having open time where you can spontaneously
do things for you *or* go and see friends.

<!-- what doesn't help -->
"Just sticking it out" isn't really a solution. If it's your only option, you need to make
that judgment call on how much of your health you're willing to sacrifice. But there's almost
always another option; it just depends on whether or not you're willing to take it. You
have more options than you think!

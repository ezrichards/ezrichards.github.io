I don't want to come across arrogant, and I am fresh out of college
and likely naive, but I thought it would be fun to make some predictions
about the future of development in 2025, and look back in a few years' time.

## Focused around code, but less

## More design

## People

## It's okay, for now

<!-- Reading code and understanding it quickly is going to be the main skill of the post-LLM developer's toolkit. Currently the best way to learn how to read and understand code quickly is by writing lots of code but I think that it's possible that there will be people in the future who suck at writing code but are good at reading it. -->


<!-- The future of development/SWE/my predictions:
- Focused around code, but less
- More product, more design, more people
- People don’t care (yet)
- The post LLM world/Sumner’s quote -->

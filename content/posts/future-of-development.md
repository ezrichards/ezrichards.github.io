I thought it would be fun to make some predictions about the future of development in 2025, 
and look back in a few years' time. This is probably naive!

## It's okay, for now

In the companies I've interned for, they usually don't care much about AI at all.
Additionally, some companies implement rules that disallow AI use for proprietary
reasons. I've heard of other companies which don't have as much of an issue with AI,
and it seems like in academia, just about everyone uses it to some capacity.

So, with that in mind, here are some predictions still centered around AI and
the software engineering industry.

## Focused around code, but less coding



*"Reading code and understanding it quickly is going to be the main skill of the post-LLM developer's toolkit. Currently the best way to learn how to read and understand code quickly is by writing lots of code but I think that it's possible that there will be people in the future who suck at writing code but are good at reading it."* - Sumner Evans

## More design

Though it has been attempted, design seems to be something AI hasn't been able to crack yet.
Whether it's literal designs of how websites and apps look, or design of systems and architecture,
this requires *people*.


## People

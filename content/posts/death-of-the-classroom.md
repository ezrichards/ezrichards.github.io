**Classrooms aren't what they once were.**
..obviously, if you've been in a classroom recently.

In my last semester as a teaching assistant for introductory computer science at Mines, I found myself saddened when I looked up. I was even more saddened when it continued and became normalized.

What I noticed wasn't just from freshmen, even though we might like to think they're less mature. I saw it throughout my undergraduate degree, in all levels, and perhaps sometimes even moreso in my graduate degree.

## What's going on?

The average university classroom is full of uninterested students. They're falling asleep or unnaturally energized by the latest caffeinated, sugary drink. You would be hard pressed to find a classroom where a single student *doesn't* have a laptop, tablet, phone, or all three in front of them.

Students chat at full volume while the professor is talking; come in late, or not show up at all. Students show up and put headphones over both ears.

## Who's responsibility is it?

A common argument you might hear in reaction to someone
making the points I have is: "Well, the students are paying a fortune to be here, so it's their loss if they don't pay attention." or, "It's not on the professors to manage adults."

These points make sense and I can see these perspectives, but I would generally disagree for a few reasons:
* College is the bare minimum now.
* The professors *should care*.
* Learning can (and should) be fun for both parties!

## What are the solutions?


## My thoughts

I will repeat: **learning should be fun for both parties; the students and the teachers.**

**August 20th, 2011:** Marc Andreessen [proclaims](https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/) 'Software 
is eating the world.' That was just over ten years ago. Today, software is still eating the world, but this
is no longer a broad proclamation nor surprise to anyone. In the years that followed, software would
become integral to our daily lives, business, and attention.

## My Story

As I learned more about computer science through my degrees, I was constantly
reminded of times gone by. I had professors who had lived through the rise of computer science; 
who invented network systems ground up, pioneered research in their fields and had advisors
from the previous generation who invented modern systems that we know today.

I met people and friends who had gone to work for their dream companies - the Microsofts, Apples, Googles, and those
people who made six figures out of college. I had heard legends (for lack of a better term) of the geniuses; the
students who made such a difference and then went on to pursue their dreams and have a steady career.

Alas, all of this seems gone these days. In my final term of college, I can't help but feel a longing for the 
days where software was eating the world. I feel as if I would've thrived, would've innovated, and would've had more fun.

## What do you do when it's no longer fun?

I've said my story a few times in different writings, but I started programming with Minecraft in Java
during my adolescent years. I learned Java and OOP before I had even learned algebra. I had learned
worst-case behavior and programmatic/problem solving thinking before I had the courage to talk to girls.
The struggle of solving a problem; of debugging, of failing, and eventually succeeding always made 
it worth it for me again.

I love writing code. It's like writing in general, or it's like a creative art. You tweak it,
revise it, pay attention to detail a thousand times. You keep on working at it and iterating
on it until it's just right.

I'm not sure if anyone else feels this way, but with the introduction of generative AI, I don't find coding fun 
anymore; and it's hard to motivate myself to code knowing a model can do it much quicker.

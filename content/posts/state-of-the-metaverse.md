*"The metaverse is a concept describing a persistent, shared, 3D virtual world, often accessed through virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) technologies. It's envisioned as an evolution of the internet, where users can interact with each other, digital environments, and virtual objects in a more immersive and embodied way than current online platforms allow."* - Google's AI Overview

## The History of the Metaverse

The Metaverse has been a concept for awhile, but really begun to gain traction when
Mark Zuckerberg renamed Facebook to Meta in 2021 and [declared his vision for the future
of the Internet](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/28/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-meta-metaverse) and the so-called Metaverse.

The Metaverse seems to include digital games like Minecraft and Roblox, or VRChat, where people interact with
each other in VR headset worlds. It has been closely tied to new technologies with augmented reality (AR),
virtual reality (VR), cryptocurrency, blockchain, and more.

Meta proclaims the Metaverse is a place to [connect, learn, shop, work, and play](https://www.meta.com/metaverse/what-is-the-metaverse/?utm_source=about.facebook.com&utm_medium=redirect). It seems like both a genuine business venture for Meta as well
as a well-supported dream by Mark Zuckerberg.

## Virtual Worlds

For as long as I can remember, as a kid playing video games on [the Wii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii), or my [iPad Mini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Mini_(1st_generation)), or Minecraft on my computer, my parents always said: *"He's off in his own little virtual world."*

You often hear the phrases *virtual worlds*, *virtual spaces*, *digital universes*, or similar. I think we use these terms because of the sheer vastness, complexity and hard-to-grasp size of the internet. But moreso we use these terms because they are accurate.

When you enter a flow state, or focus, while playing a game or working on the Internet, it feels like you're in a different world. 
Your entire attention span is absorbed, for good or for bad. Your attention enters an entirely different state than that of the physical one.

## The Metaverse Today

Many valid questions seem to be being asked about the Metaverse. Does it really exist? Is it just a word to describe
new technological innovations regarding the Internet? Is it just a hyped up thing that can't really be quantified?

<!-- TODO -->

## Predictions for the Future

Now that I've described a bit about what the Metaverse was envisioned to be and what it looks like today,
what does the future of the Internet and the Metaverse look like? If we are to embrace the concept of a Metaverse,
what does it take to get there?

### New Models of The Internet

If the Metaverse is to thrive, I think the Internet will change into more practical, direct usages.
For instance, do most Internet users really need to know or understand HTTP/HTTPS? What does knowing
a domain really mean in today's internet, when you know what services you want to use already? What
does the first page of results in your web browser mean if you'll have the information delivered to
you either via AI or the first two links? 

I think these finer technological details will become hidden,
and browsers will begin to look more like all-in-one solutions that serve your most popular services to 
you: social media, shopping, and work websites. New browsers with more customizability 
like [Arc](https://arc.net) have already been popping up.

I find that use cases of technology are *usually* driven: i.e. someone frequently may just open
Google Sheets in their web browser, and have their email open too. Another user may use their computer 
solely for gaming; while another user may stream lots of content as well as enjoy online shopping.

I think these "core use cases" will be emphasized and centralized, or grouped together; for instance,
the Google or Microsoft Office suites will become integral parts of the browser that are even easier to access. 
We will chase productivity with new models of the internet - as people begin to live more digital lives as well
as make more money.

The infrastructure of the internet will need to improve; more investment will be put toward clean
energy (the world is already [beginning to worry](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-energy-demands-water-impact-internet-hyper-consumption-era/) about this) and supporting big data
(which will become even bigger than we ever imagined) and large resource demands to support virtual
worlds. People will need to be guaranteed access to reasonably good internet, and AR/VR technology 
will likely become more reasonably priced. AI technology will continue to run rampant and also
cause resource demand.

### More Legality

The Internet will **become both more safe and more dangerous**. The value of user privacy is
becoming realized, and legislation is following, with the landmark introduction of [GDPR in Europe](https://gdpr-info.eu)
and later introduction in the [United States](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa).

## What makes something 'of the metaverse'?

<!--
- Predictions for the: new browsers & models of the internet/both safer and more dangerous- more legality (net neutrality, nsfw) as lawmakers begin to understand / new generation (tiktok and Zuckerberg clips) (redundancies with HTTPS, web browsers, OS phone and desktop and website like React Native Flutter Electron)
- New money making strategies (Fortnite, ads) or return to old ones (subscription instead of ads) (or they never went away)
    - Use-based is good, but people and businesses won’t be on board
    - Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I have no financial experience 
- Internet freedom & capitalism/democracy are conflicting ideas/or are in conflict 
- What makes something “of the metaverse”?
    - Escapism? That nostalgia that gives you (A longing for a time that you never had) Under that definition, social media is tough-does it help you escape or does it bridge the two? Or does it depend?
    - Words haven’t come yet for the metaverse
    - Escapism for people who need it
- Space vs. space/universe; we’re talking about a vast digital landscape
- Long have we used terms like the “virtual world”, and it’s fair -->

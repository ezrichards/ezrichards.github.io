*"The metaverse is a concept describing a persistent, shared, 3D virtual world, often accessed through virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) technologies. It's envisioned as an evolution of the internet, where users can interact with each other, digital environments, and virtual objects in a more immersive and embodied way than current online platforms allow."* - Google's AI Overview

## The History of the Metaverse

The Metaverse has been a concept for awhile, but really begun to gain traction when
Mark Zuckerberg renamed Facebook to Meta in 2021 and [declared his vision for the future
of the Internet](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/28/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-meta-metaverse) and the so-called Metaverse.

The Metaverse seems to include digital games like Minecraft and Roblox, or VRChat, where people interact with
each other in VR headset worlds. It has been closely tied to new technologies with augmented reality (AR),
virtual reality (VR), cryptocurrency, blockchain, and more.

Meta proclaims the Metaverse is a place to [connect, learn, shop, work, and play](https://www.meta.com/metaverse/what-is-the-metaverse/?utm_source=about.facebook.com&utm_medium=redirect). It seems like both a genuine business venture for Meta as well
as a well-supported dream by Mark Zuckerberg.

## Virtual Worlds

For as long as I can remember, as a kid playing video games on [the Wii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii), or my [iPad Mini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Mini_(1st_generation)), or Minecraft on my computer, my parents always said: *"He's off in his own little virtual world."*

You often hear the phrases *virtual worlds*, *virtual spaces*, *digital universes*, or similar. I think we use these terms because of the sheer vastness, complexity and hard-to-grasp size of the internet. But moreso we use these terms because they are accurate.

When you enter a flow state, or focus, while playing a game or working on the Internet, it feels like you're in a different world. 
Your entire attention span is absorbed, for good or for bad. Your attention enters an entirely different state than that of the physical one.

Virtual worlds aim to provide people with experiences that they literally can't or otherwise wouldn't have. Like Zuckerberg's
Meta says, it's a place to connect, learn, and play. (Though we're still seeing what it looks like to shop and work in the Metaverse.)

The Metaverse is becoming a place for virtual worlds - with aforementioned AR/VR games like VRChat, or good "old fashioned"
large games like Minecraft and Roblox.

## The Metaverse Today

Many [valid questions](https://en.as.com/latest_news/ai-is-on-the-rise-but-what-happened-to-mark-zuckerbergs-metaverse-vr-is-far-from-becoming-a-reality-n/) seem to be being asked about the Metaverse. Does it really exist? Is it just a word to describe
new technological innovations regarding the Internet? Is it just a hyped up thing that can't really be quantified?

The Metaverse today seems like an idea with a few new technologies, such as AR/VR. This idea seems
to dream of a world where everyone has access to the Internet, and our experiences become more
digital or more intertwined with the digital world.

Whether or not it's just hype, it seems like the ideas of the Metaverse are here to stay. Meta's
idea of streamlining the "connect, learn, shop, work, play" model appears to be a realistic focus.

## Predictions for the Future

Now that I've described a bit about what the Metaverse was envisioned to be and what it looks like today,
what does the future of the Internet and the Metaverse look like? If we are to embrace the concept of a Metaverse,
what does it take to get there?

### New Models of The Internet

If the Metaverse is to thrive, I think the Internet will change into more practical, direct usages.
For instance, do most Internet users really need to know or understand HTTP/HTTPS? What does knowing
a domain really mean in today's internet, when you know what services you want to use already? What
does the first page of results in your web browser mean if you'll have the information delivered to
you either via AI or the first two links? 

I think these finer technological details will become hidden,
and browsers will begin to look more like all-in-one solutions that serve your most popular services to 
you: social media, shopping, and work websites. New browsers with more customizability 
like [Arc](https://arc.net) have already been popping up.

I find that use cases of technology are *usually* driven: i.e. someone frequently may just open
Google Sheets in their web browser, and have their email open too. Another user may use their computer 
solely for gaming; while another user may stream lots of content as well as enjoy online shopping.

I think these "core use cases" will be emphasized and centralized, or grouped together; for instance,
the Google or Microsoft Office suites will become integral parts of the browser that are even easier to access. 
We will chase productivity with new models of the internet - as people begin to live more digital lives as well
as make more money.

The infrastructure of the internet will need to improve; more investment will be put toward clean
energy (the world is already [beginning to worry](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-energy-demands-water-impact-internet-hyper-consumption-era/) about this) and supporting big data
(which will become even bigger than we ever imagined) and large resource demands to support virtual
worlds. People will need to be guaranteed access to reasonably good internet, and AR/VR technology 
will likely become more reasonably priced. AI technology will continue to run rampant and also
cause resource demand.

### More Legality

The Internet will **become both more safe and more dangerous**. The value of user privacy is
becoming realized, and legislation is following, with the landmark introduction of [GDPR in Europe](https://gdpr-info.eu)
and later introduction in the [United States](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa).

Lawmakers will begin to better understand the internet, following questions over what they really
understand in the Zuckerberg ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stXgn2iZAAY), [2](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/04/the-strangest-moments-from-the-zuckerberg-testimony/557672/), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncbb5B85sd0)) and [Chew trials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8biKgSmS3U).

However, the internet remains a dangerous place, especially for youth, as battles remain over pornography websites, with [some states adopting age-verification laws](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/16/adult-website-age-verification-states). Additional legislation is
being [enacted in the UK](https://www.wired.com/story/the-age-checked-internet-has-arrived/).

Social media could be one of the most dangerous places of all for youth on the internet. Countries are beginning to
[impose legislation on this too](https://tech.co/news/countries-age-restrictions-social-media) as well as [age verification
laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media_age_verification_laws_in_the_United_States#/media/File:Social_media_age_verification_laws_as_of_may_3,_2025.png). [The Social Dilemma](https://thesocialdilemma.com) portrays
a lot of these issues, and [Frances Haugen whistleblowing testimony](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/24/frances-haugen-i-never-wanted-to-be-a-whistleblower-but-lives-were-in-danger) urges action on social media companies
that are mistreating children and their data.

In the United States, [COPPA](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-coppa) protects some data for children under 13 years of age.

Additionally, [net neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality) appears to be an ongoing legal battle
for the internet, with most recent legislation on both sides [in 2017 and 2018](https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/campaigns/net-neutrality-timeline/).

### New Revenue Sources

*Disclaimer: This is not financial advice and I do not have significant financial experience.*

New revenue sources, or a return of the same, will also define the future of the Internet and Metaverse.

Despite the jokes about it, the rise of the [battle pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_pass) following success in Fortnite, shows that a new innovation in "free" games can define new eras of revenue on the internet.

The plethora of subscriptions, especially in streaming services, seem a surefire
revenue source for companies. I would imagine that subscriptions can help recurring revenue (rather than one-time revenue)
and help companies predict their revenue in the longer term.

Use-based services are a revenue source I would like to see more of. Rather than paying subscriptions for months
or years, you could pay per use of service, and cancel when you wish rather than jumping through hoops to
cancel your service.

**Internet freedom and capitalism are ideas often in conflict.** The "free internet" is an idea of a place
where everyone has access to learning, webpages, and more. Free games like Roblox with in-app or in-game
purchases seem to fit this model, as long as you have access to the base game or the base webpage.

The one revenue source I haven't mentioned is ads, which are arguably the biggest revenue source
because they require no action from anybody and rely on data being sold. This fits the *free internet*
model, but as mentioned with legality and user privacy, has issues. This may become a tougher market over time.

## What makes the Metaverse?

Words haven't come yet for the Metaverse, or at least coherent definitions.

I think the Metaverse hasn't really materialized yet, but it will. I think 
something *of the Metaverse* is something that advances technology in ways
we haven't seen so far - like advanced VR technology or AR glasses.

**The metaverse looks like escapism.** You can escape into our so-called *virtual worlds*,
meeting people from around the world with similar interests. You can learn and play
and get lost in a world entirely different from your own. Some people need escapism 
from whatever they're going through in life.

I'm cautiously optimistic about the future of the Metaverse; I don't think we need
to put too much stock into every technology that comes along, like crypto and blockchain,
but we can embrace the ideas of advancing Internet technology.

However, to get to the internet of the future, much work needs to be done with the
legality of it, revenue sources, user privacy, big data, and more.

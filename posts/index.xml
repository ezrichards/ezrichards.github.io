It&rsquo;s envisioned as an evolution of the internet, where users can interact with each other, digital environments, and virtual objects in a more immersive and embodied way than current online platforms allow.&rdquo;</em> - Google&rsquo;s AI Overview</p><h2 id="the-history-of-the-metaverse">The History of the Metaverse</h2><p>The Metaverse has been a concept for awhile, but really begun to gain traction when
Mark Zuckerberg renamed Facebook to Meta in 2021 and<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/28/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-meta-metaverse">declared his vision for the future

and look back in a few years&rsquo; time, especially with all of the AI things going on.
This is probably naive and wrong!</p><h2 id="its-okay-for-now">It&rsquo;s okay, for now</h2><p>At the companies I&rsquo;ve interned for, they usually don&rsquo;t care much about AI at all,

I was taking 6 classes (18 credits). I was a lead TA for a class and was co-managing
the (now-defunct) OreCart project. I was the<a href="https://acm.mines.edu">Mines ACM</a> President
and<a href="https://mineshspc.com">HSPC</a> Chair. Additionally, for a little while during the start

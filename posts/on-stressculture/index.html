<time datetime=2024-08-24>Aug 24, 2024</time><br><br><h1 id=saying-no>Saying no</h1><p>The best advice I ever got from my research advisor (or honestly anyone)
was not how to code Python better, communicate with people,
write scientific papers, do research, or anything like that;
it was a small snippet of advice geared at managing your life:
saying no.</p><p>His analogy goes as follows: work is like a gas. If you just
try to run around waving it toward some direction, or trying
to contain it from spreading, it&rsquo;s going to do nothing. More of
it is going to keep finding you, too, if you don&rsquo;t set boundaries.
You have to <strong>build walls</strong> in your life to stop it from spreading <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>.</p><p>This advice is worth spending an entire section on because
it&rsquo;s genuinely lifechanging.</p><h2 id=stressculture>Stressculture</h2><p>I always thought I needed to prove myself to everybody. Part of
it was personal, but part of it was because I felt threatened or afraid
of the culture. I never thought I would succeed unless I worked harder
than absolutely everybody all of the time. Unfortunately, these sentiments
seem pretty common in today&rsquo;s age, and almost exemplify the American dream
of becoming rich and wealthy if you just work harder than everybody always.</p><p>Enter a term that I like to call <em>stressculture</em>: A culture where performance
outweighs the good of your own health and emphasizes greatness at the cost
of immense stress.</p><p>In the Spring 2024 semester, I stressed myself out to a near breaking point.</p><p>I was taking 6 classes (18 credits): algorithms, tech startups, HCI, development of 210,
macOS app development, and a humanities class. I was still a lead TA for 128,
and I was managing the (now-defunct, but then startup) OreCart project, and I was
also the Mines ACM President and HSPC Chair, and additionally, for a little while during
the start of spring, I was preparing to present my research at SIGCSE. I also played
intramural soccer a little later in the spring <sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>.</p><p>If you want that in credit-hour terms, I&rsquo;d probably say it was around 27. If you
want that in real human being terms, it sucked. I stopped eating a lot, and what I did eat was crap. I
stopped exercising, because there was seemingly no time to. I stopped meditating. I slept less, because
I needed to get up and get to the library ASAP.</p><p>The only times I ever <em>stopped</em> and did nothing were on my walks to and from
school since I lived so close &ndash; and even then, I would use those times to &ldquo;get ahead&rdquo;
in the areas I had inevitably been neglecting. Because, no matter what you think, the
old analogy holds: <strong>something has to give</strong>. I was quite simply doing too much for
things not to give; giving my attention to one thing meant seriously downgrading how
effective I was at another thing.</p><p>I cheated, sort of. On the walks, I would think about what I needed to do for Mines ACM
and HSPC. At Mines ACM, I&rsquo;d think about OreCart since all of our engineers were there.
At home, after my mountains of work, I would try to catch up on the development of 210
and my 128 TA tasks.</p><p>There was no time for family or friends whatsoever. I made two new friends that I enjoyed that
semester, and made an effort to see them, which was incredibly stressful too, as I
knew I was hurting every other aspect of my life.</p><p>Looking back, it was miserable. I&rsquo;m impressed I got through especially with the
compounding effects of not treating myself well, which would just make it harder for myself.
The only things that got me through were reading and journaling and sheer, foolish determination.</p><p>I remember the point at which I wanted it to all stop was when I was speaking to my roommate;
he would ask about things like ACM and OreCart, and I would try to explain, only to have
long, awkward, 15-second pauses where I would look around and try to find my words because
my head was so jam-packed with (literally) 10 things at the same time. My memory got much
worse, and I developed a stutter because there was so much going on in my head and it was
moving quicker than my mouth could.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t worth it. I finished out the semester, but to many people&rsquo;s surprise, I
immediately resigned as Mines ACM President + HSPC Chair (despite what I think was
a community that I built that enjoyed my leadership) because I just <em>couldn&rsquo;t</em> cope.
OreCart would unfortunately fall through over the summer, which was incredibly sad,
but not bad for my health. I tried to promise myself I would never do 18 credits again,
but I did again in the fall; however, I coped much better having much less on my plate.</p><h2 id=not-so-unusual>Not so unusual</h2><p>Unfortunately, this is the saddening reality for a lot of people. I&rsquo;m in a privileged
position where I&rsquo;m economically stable, but I know people in these positions who aren&rsquo;t
quite the same and need to work on top of school to survive. This culture also encourages
coping in the wrong ways, with alcohol or drugs, which I can proudly say I never did, but I
again know people who cope that way.</p><p>I recommend everyone I know to do less, probably to an annoying extent. People come to me
in similar situations and I tell them to say no to things - we often say yes to everything
because 1) we&rsquo;re nice people, but 2) we see opportunity in things. If you want to say
yes to something, sleep on it. Ideally give it a week to decide. See how willing you are
to say yes after waiting awhile.</p><p>It&rsquo;s hard to do less, especially in the middle of a school term, but there is really
always a safe way out: whether it&rsquo;s resigning from a project, withdrawing from a class,
or simply taking a break (which I have seen even professors do!).</p><p>However, the easier way to do this is to set boundaries (or with our analogy, build walls).
As an adult (barely), I&rsquo;ve noticed that older people and adults are great at this, and this
goes unspoken for quite some time. Whenever you&rsquo;re staring down your next semester or work
project or new big idea, ask yourself what you&rsquo;re willing to sacrifice, what things you could
leave behind, and how you&rsquo;re going to change from doing everything all of the time.</p><p>Think about the big things: what do I hope to accomplish over the next few months?
How does this relate to where I truly want to be in life? How does this relate to what I
truly want to do?</p><p>..maybe equally if not more importantly, <strong>think about the small things</strong> too. It astounds me how many
people ignore, for instance, time to eat or sleep in their schedule. They just don&rsquo;t care or pretend
it doesn&rsquo;t matter. IT DOES! These are the foundations that will allow you to do things to begin with.
You don&rsquo;t have to schedule friend-time, but think about having open time where you can spontaneously
do things for you <em>or</em> go and see friends.</p><h2 id=a-fun-story>A fun story</h2><p>One day I went down to my friend&rsquo;s cubicle in the CS PhD offices. He had a sticky
note up in the center of his desk which read: &ldquo;Say no!&rdquo; &ndash; he works for the
professor who I used to, so I asked him if the professor had given him the same
advice. He said: &ldquo;No, Ethan, you told me that.&rdquo;</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Maybe this is where the analogy breaks down, but imagine
